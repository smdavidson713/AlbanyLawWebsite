                    <h3>Am I a Lobbyist?</h3>
                    <p>In this module, we will provide you with information regarding what actions constitute lobbying under New York State law so that you can make a decision as to whether you need to follow certain requirements under state law that apply to organizations and individuals that the law considers lobbyists.  This information is meant to help you determine if your organization engages in a form of lobbying. First, you will receive information about the general activities that the Joint Commission on Public Integrity (JCOPE) has deemed to constitute lobbying under the law. You can compare these guidelines to your organization’s behavior to determine if your organization engages in lobbying.  Next, you can learn about the different types of lobbying and determine which type of lobbying your organization conducts.  Because social media usage can play a large role in lobbying efforts, this module also includes information on how social media activity factors into different types of lobbying. Please click “Next” below to start learning about the types of activities that constitute lobbying. </p>

                    <p>The video below will help you understand 1-c(c) activities.  Section 1-c(c) of JCOPE’s Legislative Law, also known as the “lobbying act,” defines certain activities as lobbying activities. Under this act, a variety of activities can be considered lobbying activities.  Therefore, developing an understanding of section 1-c(c) is a crucial step in determining if your organization engages in any form of lobbying. Watch the video below to learn more about the activities defined in 1-c(c). </p>

                    <h3>Do I need to Report My Activities?</h3>
                    <p>The information in this module is provided to help you determine if you need to report your organization’s activities in order to comply with New York State’s lobbying reporting requirements. First, this tool will direct you to review the activities that constitute lobbying. Reviewing these activities will be helpful if you need a reminder on which activities your organization conducts that you have determined constitute lobbying.  Next, this tool explains the $5,000 expenditure threshold set by New York state.  This threshold is important, because if you determine that lobbying expenses incurred by your organization exceed $5,000, you will be required to report them.  Next, this module will explain and define the different types of expenses that you must account for when determining if your organization meets the $5,000 threshold. These expenses consist of reportable compensation, reportable expenses, funds spent on social media, and lobbying days.  Each component is explained in its own step of the module.  It is important to understand each of these concepts so you can determine what conduct will apply towards the threshold, and conclude if you meet the reporting requirement threshold. </p>
